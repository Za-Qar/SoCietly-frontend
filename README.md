### The project brief

*"How can we better keep track of ex-bootcampers after the course?"*

We broke this down into a series of epics to monitor our progress as we worked on the problem. We wanted to focus two main sections: 
- Career - The first job an alumnus has and their career trajectory as they advance on this new path.
- Contact - How School of Code staff can manage their contact with alumni, including creating events to grow the community.

### Our Solution

After conducting user research, we found that School of Code staff wanted to increase contact with alumni and keep track of bootcamper's career progression to better measure the impact of the School of Code. We found that most people weren't as in contact with other ex-bootcampers as they wanted to be, and were looking for ways to keep in touch or meet up with other bootcampers and coaches.

### Project Details

Worked within an agile team of 5 people to build a full-stack application for the School of Code in 4 weeks. The platform aims to strengthen the community after the course through event organisation, while allowing coaches to gauge the wider impact of the course. We utilised tools such as Jira to plan and work in short sprints, as well as Balsamiq and Adobe XD, to build wireframe and hi- fidelity designs. I focused primarily on front-end implementation using React, as well as the front-end design and user experience. We implemented external modules including Nodemailer to integrate event reminders and updates, and the Google Maps API for event locations.
